    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "Equity is a core goal for the slate of marijuana policy coming to New York state in the [Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act](https://cannabis.ny.gov/). For the policy to be truly equitable, majority Black communities of Albany that have suffered from over a century of systemic racist policies and the war on drugs - should not have to suffer additional harm. In fact those previously impacted communities should be assisted to gain the most from any new legal marijuana policy.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<u>Research Question</u>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "With Albany, NY recently opting in to the legal marijuana industry, licensing policy is currently being developed. The following research looks to answer the following research question about the proposed licensing policy's racial impact: \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<i>What is the racial impact of adopting marijuana policy based on tobacco licenses that require distances of at least 500ft from church and school properties?</i>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<u>Methodology</u>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To answer the above question, this research links census and local property data to give a rich picture of selected census tracts that represent North End, South End, Arbor Hill and Pine Hills districts. Basing research dataset boundaries on census tracts gives opportunities to link the [Mapgeo](https://albanyny.mapgeo.io/) tool's rich property information with the census's extensive historical demographic data. Combining micro and macro-level data will assist in tying local community phenomena to broader systemic issues and analyzing racial equity impact.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<u>Research Findings</u>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This report's research finds that if marijuana licenses are based on the distancing restrictions of current liquor license policy then South End and Arbor Hill - two of Albany's historic Black communities - will have the highest decrease in available properties zoned for mixed-use. Reducing the amount of available business space will put those Black and Brown community members at a disadvantage to their neighbors. Therefore the licensing policy that Albany is currently considering does not hold to the racial equity goals that are guiding NY state marijuana policy.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<u>Policy Recommendation</u>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In conclusion, this report recommends that Albany consider basing marijuana policy on current tobacco sales policy and or other policy that does not place distance-based restrictions on licenses.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Find a link to current NY guidance for retail tobacco dealers below:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "[A Guide for Retail Tobacco Dealers](https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/tobacco_control/retail_tobacco_dealers_guide.htm)\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The NY state policies are sensible and stated with the purpose to reduce the exposure of youth to tobacco products. Among the dozen guidelines, only tobacco advertisements are restricted by distance. Reducing distance restrictions on businesses will cause less barriers to potential marijuana businesses across the city - including majority Black communities.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Lastly, the authors of this report recommend that the City of Albany conducts racial impact assessment before adopting this and other future policy related to the legal marijuana industry."

Combining micro and macro-level data will assist in tying local community phenomena to broader systemic issues. Therefore this approach is beneficial when analyzing racial equity impact.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "For example, note in the below census tract demographics table that all four majority Black communities have lower median household incomes than the two majority White communities. The location of these income disparities can be traced back through the decades to at least the early twentieth century's redlining policy where the city and banking institutions enforced economic oppression targetted against those same Black communities."

    "#### Outcome\n",
    "For the coming slate of marijuana policy to be truly equitable, majority Black communities of Albany that have suffered from over a century of systemic racist policies and the war on drugs - should not have to suffer additional harm. Yet, the above analysis shows that if marijuana licenses are based on the distancing restrictions of current liquor license policy South End and Arbor Hill - two of Albany's historic Black communities - will have the highest decrease in available properties zoned for mixed-use. Reducing the amount of available business space will put those Black and Brown community members at a disadvantage to their neighbors. Therefore the licensing policy that Albany is currently considering does not hold to the racial equity goals that are guiding NY state marijuana policy."

    "[A Guide for Retail Tobacco Dealers](https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/tobacco_control/retail_tobacco_dealers_guide.htm)\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The NY state policies are sensible and stated with the purpose to reduce the exposure of youth to tobacco products. Among the dozen guidelines, only tobacco advertisements are restricted by distance. Reducing distance restrictions on businesses will cause less barriers to potential marijuana businesses across the city - including majority Black communities."
